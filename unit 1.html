<h1> Led-Zeppelin </h1>

<body>

	<h3> Why I like them? </h3>

	<p> I'm a little biased I think, one of my grandpas is the drummer in a Led-Zeppelin tribute band. I'm a fan of classic
		rock in general but I love Zeppelin in particuler because of all of the storytelling they do in their music. Robert Plant
		the lead singer was a big Tolkien fan, and he often put refernces to the books in his songs, and drew inspiration from
		the fantasy genre often. One of my favorite songs <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> is often described as the hero's journey in the form of a song. </p>
